Todo
====

* Lodge ticket about customisation of EDS via the DOM element -- pattern model

* Control panel for easily configuring AuthZ and other underlying Plugin
  aspects.  Just like https://github.com/collective/collective.castle/blob/master/src/collective/castle/control_panel.py would be good.

* Improve inclusion of JavaScript resources in page.

* Tests. Tests. Tests.
